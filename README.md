# data_visualization
 exploring data through visual representations

 ### Description:

 Data scientists have written an impressive array of visualization and analysis tools in Python, many of which are available to you as well.
 One of the most popula tools is Matplotib, a mathematical plotting library. We'll use Matplotib to make simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots. Then we'll create a more interesting data set based on the concept of a random walk - a visualization generated from a series of random decisions.

 We'll also use a pakcage called Plotly, which creates visualizations that automatically resize to fit a variety of display devices. These visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as emphasizing particular aspects of the data set when users hover over different parts of the visualization. We'll use Plotly to analyze the results of rolling dice.
